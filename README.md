This project discusses the importance of water quality prediction using machine learning models and data science techniques. In recent years, water quality has been put at risk due to industrial and agricultural activities, oil spills, and other environmental concerns. 
As a result, it is critical for us to develop accurate predictive models for water quality. Using machine learning and data science, we can analyse vast amounts of data that can help us build models to predict water quality.
